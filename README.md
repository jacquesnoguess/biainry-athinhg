Binary to Decimal Conversion (binary_to_decimal())
Write a function named binary_to_decimal(binary_str) that takes in an eight-bit binary number as a string (e.g., "00001011") and returns the decimal equivalent as an integer.
Constraints: You should not use Python's built-in functions like int() with base arguments, or bin().
Decimal to Binary Conversion (decimal_to_binary)
Write a function named decimal_to_binary(decimal_num) that takes in a decimal number (e.g., 11) no larger than 255 and returns the eight-bit binary equivalent as a string (e.g., "00001011").
Constraints: You should not use Python's built-in functions like bin().
